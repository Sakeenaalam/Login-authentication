## Features

- **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account by providing their details such as username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Users with existing accounts can log in using their credentials.
- **Redirects**: If a user tries to access the login page without an account, they will be redirected to the signup page. Conversely, if a user tries to access the signup page while already logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.
- **Landing Page**: Upon successful authentication, users are directed to the landing page of the resort booking website.

1. `signup.html`: HTML file for signing up with the resort booking website.
